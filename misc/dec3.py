gov '16 
2/9 how well do the values held by society + gov't reflect mine as an individual? 
	our value rankings represent my views. tweitsj? 
		more or less. i think tolerance of others should trump freedom of speech, and i feel very strongly and for no particular reason that. 
2/10 why is the rule of law not men so important in the u.s.? 
	rule of law should have been #1 on the list. tweitsj? 
	nah. i think inherently it should be lower because the rule of law itself needs something to base itself off of.  
	essential   |    optional   |    aspirational 
	magna carta      stanton        frankfurter 
	madison                         MLK 
	hugo black                      anthony kennedy
	diane wood 
2/12 why do gov'ts exist and how do they serve/control the people to maintain an orderly and productive society? 
	"the purpose of gov't is ore to protect than provide." tweitsj? 
		i think the statement's pretty justified: usually when gov'ts provide something on a federal level, the purpose of it is to protect and secure a decent state of living for everyone. i think other things that are provided, like education, are a little meaningless if there's a mass threat or a gov'ts people are unsafe. that isn't to say education and the like aren't hugely important, i just think an obligation to protect edges out other gov't-granted services that are ultimately just privilege. 
	15 purposes of gov't: maintain social order, provide services, nat'l security, control economy, form treaties, support those in need, enforce justice, make laws, enforce laws, maintain foreign relationships, maintaining infrastructure, protect human rights, provide healthcare, maintain national culture, improve the lives of people 
2/24 who rules??? 
	what similarities do you observe with the countries you created? 
	small, culture based on what they export, concentrated 
	frasierev on scum: theoretically free still gives ability for domination 
2/29 how did the dec. of independence come to fruition? 
	look, the subway sucks today! (but i guess that was also my problem as well...)
3/9 why do supporters of each candidate feel that their candidate is the best, if not the only choice for the presidency? 
	dn: young people don't vote as much as older people because there aren't enugh resources to guide new voters through a relatively complicated process. while younger people definitely have an interest in politics, the process of registering and caucusing or voting in primaries may be too much work for them to take initiative for. 
3/10 
	free college 
	healthcare reform (medicaid/medicare)
	immigration reform (paths to citizenship/deportation plans)
	carpet bombing isis
	living wage 
3/21 how are decisions and powers separated between the federal gov't and the state? 
3/23 to what extent should the "full fairth and credit" clause be applied? 
	I MEAN TECHNICALLY it should be just a high school diploma, hat should be the same. like people can have different perceptions of it, like when you get a job or apply to college or whatever something like stuy would be different from like staten island community college high school at night perceptuallyl but in te field of the law they and anyone affiliated with it they should be the same.
